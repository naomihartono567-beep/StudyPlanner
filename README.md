# StudyPlanner
StudyPlanner is a web app built with Flask, Jinja templates, and SQLite to help students plan study time. Users can add subjects, tasks (with due dates and priority), and fixed activities, then generate a schedule in available time slots. It also tracks completion and shows weekly progress summaries.
